## Code of Conduct
* Prefer making a separate branch for your work. It is fine if you directly make changes in master branch but then be extra careful.
* DO NOT DELETE CODE THAT YOU HAVEN'T ADDED. Prefer commenting the code instead. You may delete code under obvious circumstances.
* Add files in appropriate folders. Make folder if necessary with meaningful names.
* Keep the code properly indented and add precise comments for others to understand.
